# New-System-for-Community-Detection

I am currently in the process of developing an innovative community detection system that harnesses a comprehensive suite of community detection algorithms. This system employs a range of techniques, including majority voting and boosting, to amalgamate the results generated by these algorithms, thereby enhancing accuracy and overall effectiveness. This endeavor represents the culmination of my undergraduate studies as it serves as my B.Sc. final project. 

Additionally, I am actively engaged in the task of identifying communities within Stock Markets.

This repository encompasses the following components:

1. Codebase for the development of the combined community detection algorithms system.
2. Presentation materials detailing the development process of the combined community detection algorithms system.
3. Source code for the community detection process specifically tailored to Stock Markets.
4. A final project I designed for a probability and statistics course, focusing on the subject of community detection.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further information about this project.

## Community Detection Using classic algorithms
You can find the Community Detection codes using classic algorithms in "CD_Classic" folder. In the .py file, there is a system that utilizes the following classic community detection algorithms:
- louvain
- leiden
- hirarchical
- spectral_clustering
- walk_trap
- mcl
- dbscan
- mean_shift
The input consists of the Karate Club dataset, while the output comprises the identified communities generated through the aforementioned algorithms, combined using the majority vote approach.

## Community Detection Using Deep Learning algorithms
All the codes of different algorithms are in "CD_DL" folder. The approach is similar to "CD_Classic"

## Detecting similar stocks by integrating community
In the stock market, certain stocks exhibit similarities in their behavior. For instance, during events like the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the stocks of pharmaceutical companies tend to gain increased value. This phenomenon suggests that stocks form interconnected groups or 'communities.' Identifying and categorizing these communities can be instrumental in making more informed investment decisions.

Community detection algorithms are a powerful tool for identifying and categorizing these communities. These algorithms can be used to construct stock networks based on stock prices and detect dynamic communities within those networks. By analyzing these communities, investors can gain insights into the complex relationships between stocks and improve their investment strategies.

We have applied community detection algorithms to stock market analysis in various ways. In our study, we used community detection techniques to simplify stock market analysis and selected the Tehran stock exchange for analysis. Another study introduced a methodology for constructing stock networks based on stock prices and detecting dynamic communities. Yet another study explored community detection for the New York stock market and showed the rationality of community detection on the stock market network.

In the case of Iran's stock market, I am currently engaged in the development of a novel system that uses community detection algorithms for the detection of stock communities. The system is being applied to analyze the dataset from Iran's stock market, and the research paper titled 'Detecting Similar Stocks by Integrating Community Detection Algorithms: A Case Study on the Iran Stock Market' is currently in the preparation stage.

Overall, community detection algorithms are a valuable tool for stock market analysis. By identifying and categorizing stock communities, investors can gain insights into the complex relationships between stocks and improve their investment strategies. The use of community detection algorithms in stock market analysis is a growing field of research, and there are many opportunities for future studies to explore this topic further

## Presentation
You can find the PowerPoint presentation (as well as its PDF format) in the "PRESENTATION" folder.

## Community Detection Project
While working on this research project, I designed a course project with the same topic, community detection and methods for graph clustering. In "Community-Detection-Project" folder, you'll discover a project centered around the theme of "Graph Clustering Methods". Our approach involves employing community detection algorithms for effective clustering. The primary objective of this project is to showcase the practical applications of probability to students. Alongside this, participants will gain exposure to the realm of recommender systems. Notably, we crafted and executed this project during our tenure as teaching assistants for the probability course at Sharif University of Technology. I had the privilege of leading this group of teaching assistants.
