# New-System-for-Community-Detection

I am currently developing a novel community detection system that leverages a comprehensive set of community detection algorithms. This system employs various methods, including majority vote and boosting, to combine the outputs of these algorithms for enhanced accuracy and effectiveness. In this repository, the codes and presentations for this goal are provided. This project is my B.Sc. Project.

## Presentation
You can find the PowerPoint presentation (as well as its PDF format) in the "PRESENTATION" folder, alongside the report of the project.

## Community Detection Using classic algorithms
You can find the Community Detection codes using classic algorithms in "CD_Classic" folder. In the .py file, there is a system that utilizes the following classic community detection algorithms:
- louvain
- leiden
- hirarchical
- spectral_clustering
- walk_trap
- mcl
- dbscan
- mean_shift
The input consists of the Karate Club dataset, while the output comprises the identified communities generated through the aforementioned algorithms, combined using the majority vote approach.

## Community Detection Using Deep Learning algorithms
All the codes of different algorithms are in "CD_DL" folder. The approach is similar to "CD_Classic"
